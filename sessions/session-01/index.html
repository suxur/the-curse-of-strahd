                <h1>The Curse of Strahd - Session 1</h1>

<p>You are all around a campfire at small waypoint in the Misty Forest just off the Trade Way path. This waypoint, Stardrift Haven, offers a safe nights rest to travelers when journeying south from Daggerford towards Triel or Baldur's Gate. Travelers and adventures know it's better to spend the night alongside others than to be caught camping alone. In Stardrift Haven, campfires and drink are shared, stories are told and the company is as warm as the fires. Tonight, Stardrift Haven feels empty, each time you've been here before there are at least three or four camps setup... tonight there is only one, shared by four, an elf, a half-elf, a tiefling and a human. You have all met many in your journey's but each face is a stranger tonight.</p>

<p>Allow characters to introduce themselves and share stories.</p>

<p><em>Music - Intro</em></p>

<p>Nearby you hear a twig snap then followed by a set of offbeat footsteps... slowly getting closer. You each grip your weapons tightly when you see an old man stagger drunkenly out of the dark forest, his right hand clutching a wine bottle. Before you can react he plops down and starts warming his hands with the fire. "...you lads don't mind if an old man warms his bones, do ya? I've got wine..." and he reaches into his coat pulling out another bottle of wine and holds it out as an offering.</p>

<p>If the characters ask the old man to leave, read the following and then proceed to [Old Man's Story]the old man says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I have a story to tell all of you. First you listen, then I'll go."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the characters take the wine and ignore the old man or asks who he is, proceed to [Old Man's Story]</p>

<p>The wine is the rich Champagne du le Stomp.</p>

<h4>Old Man's Story</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The old man fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire. The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire's core. "I've come from an ancient land whose name is long forgotten - a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from our homes, and now we wander the lost roads." The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man beÂ­ing knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side. The old man continues. "One night, a wounded soldier staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn't say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our own and followed him back toward his homeland. His enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we didn't give him up, even when their assassins fell upon us like wolves." Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes. "This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he thanked us. He said, 'I owe you my life. Stay as long as you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will always be safe here."' The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers. The old man's face becomes a somber mask. "A curse has befallen our noble prince, turning him into a tyrant. Our leader, Madam Eva, has foreseen an  end our dread lord's curse and his troubled soul put to rest."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The old man picks himself up and stumbles into the forest, his silhouette fading into the darkness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The woods grow quiet, and the air grows chill. Your fire sputters as a low mist gathers around the edges of your camp, growing closer as the night wears on. By morning, the fog hangs thick in the air, turning the trees around you into gray ghosts. Then you notice these aren't the same trees that surrounded you the night before.</p>
</blockquote>
