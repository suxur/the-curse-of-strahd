<h3><a name="baron-vallakovich-invitation"></a>Baron Vallakovich's Invitation</h3>

<p><a href="/locations/vallaki#burgomaster-mansion">N3 - Burgomaster's Mansion</a></p>

<p>Baron Vallakovich is ever-fearful for the stability of his position, and fears especially the machinations of Strahd’s agents within the walls of Vallaki. The Vallakovich line has long maintained an enmity for the house of Wachter, and that rivalry has only deepened between Vargas and Fiona.</p>

<p>Vargas believes strongly that Fiona Wachter has designs on his position, and suspects Fiona to be an active conspirator and servant of the Devil. He knows also that two of his servants have vanished in recent weeks, and believes - incorrectly - that Lady Wachter abducted them to steal information regarding his habits and defenses.</p>

<p>However, he has been unable to act on his suspicions, as the ancient house of Wachter is well-established in town and has both wealth, property, and friends in many places, including a number of vassals that work the land Fiona owns. If Vallakovich were to move openly against Lady Wachter, Vallaki would erupt into riots, and his life’s work would be lost. As such, he has faced difficulty in recruiting guards to investigate Lady Wachter’s secrets. Izek, of course, is far from a subtle inquisitor.</p>

<h4>Beginning the Event</h4>

<p>If the Baron learns that the daughter of Barovia’s burgomaster is in Vallaki, or if the actions of the PCs lead him to believe that they may be potential allies, he swiftly sends Izek to personally invite the party over for tea. The PCs might also request an audience with the Baron in an effort to find sanctuary for Ireena, or to gain access to his library or a treasure hidden in his attic.</p>

<p>Should he find them trustworthy and firmly opposed to the Devil’s servants, he asks them to investigate Lady Wachter’s home for signs of conspiracy or heresy. As a reward, he offers to assign a pair of guards to watch over Ireena Kolyana for as long as she remains in Vallaki, as well as the substantial sum of 200 gp for their services.</p>

<p>He invites the PCs to begin their investigation in his mansion, and suggests they interview his wife and son. Lydia is able to provide no useful information, but the PCs are likely to uncover the servants’ fate upon recovering Victor Vallakovich’s journal from his study in the attic.</p>

<h4>Developments</h4>

<p>Should the PCs accept the invitation (which Ireena strongly urges for the sake of diplomacy), they are welcomed by Vargas’ wife, Lydia, and guided into the Den (area N3E), where the Baron meets them after a few minutes of waiting. In the meantime, Lydia does her best to entertain the PCs, though she is so lost to Vargas’ beliefs that it is clear that she is barely able to process any other information. If the PCs make any questionable remarks or questions, Lydia only laughs fearfully and ignores their words entirely.</p>

<p>While enjoying a bitter-tasting tea brewed by the cook, the Baron asks the PCs their opinions of his “magnificent society.” He waxes at length regarding the work he has done to keep Strahd’s influence out of the valley, and brags about the “perfect happiness” enjoyed by his subjects. His speech patterns are streaked with nervous tics and repeated phrases (e.g., “All will be well!”), and his face never loses its constant, gritted smile. During this time, Lydia falls entirely silent, speaking only when spoken to and making clearly scripted responses.</p>

<p>Should the PCs degrade or question Vallaki’s laws or culture in any way, the Baron’s attitude toward them quickly chills; if the PCs insult any tenet of Vallakian society, the Baron orders them to leave. Should the PCs directly challenge the Baron’s authority, or if the situation otherwise goes rapidly downhill, he waits for the PCs to leave before sending twelve guards to arrest them, seize their weapons, and run them out of town. For more information on running the Baron’s animosity, see Bʀᴇᴀᴋɪɴɢ ᴛʜᴇ Lᴀᴡ above.</p>

<p>Should tea-time go well, the Baron asks the PCs to investigate the indiscretions of Lady Wachter or the disappearances of his servants. Additionally, should Ireena’s appearance and personality charm him, he is likely to begin making preparations for an engagement between her and his son, Victor. After the “travesty” of a mate that Stella Wachter proved to be, it’s important the the Baron find a properly blue-blooded and demure woman for his son to marry. If the PCs or Ireena mention her need for a place to stay, the Baron instantly offers his own home - after all, there can be no greater sanctuary from the Devil than the domicile of his greatest enemy.</p>

<p>If the PCs reject the Baron’s invitation to tea, he is grossly offended, and orders Izek to punish them severely if caught making the slightest infraction.</p>

<h4>Completing the Event</h4>

<p>In the course of carrying out the Baron’s wishes, the PCs may choose to investigate Lady Wachter further, either by infiltrating her estate or through subterfuge.</p>

<p>If she catches PCs snooping around her home - especially after breaking and entering - Lady Wacher first attempts to persuade them to leave peacefully, claiming full innocence of any crime or ill behavior. If the PCs claim to be convinced of her guilt, Lady Wachter leads them to the room of her daughter, Stella, and describes the terrible crimes that Victor Vallakovich has brought upon her family. If the PCs appear sympathetic, Fiona may then attempt to assign them the quest Lᴀᴅʏ Wᴀᴄʜᴛᴇʀ’ꜱ Wɪꜱʜ, as described above.</p>

<p>If the PCs approach Lady Wachter and attempt to engage her socially, with the goal of gaining access to her secrets or tricking her into revealing incriminating information, she is more than happy to invite a party of newcomers to dine with her at Wachterhaus. If the PCs appear sympathetic, Fiona may then attempt to assign them the quest Lᴀᴅʏ Wᴀᴄʜᴛᴇʀ’ꜱ Wɪꜱʜ, as described above.</p>

<h4>Developments</h4>

<p>If the Baron is informed of Lady Wachter’s treasonous plans, he instantly asks the PCs to seek out incriminating evidence that will sway the town to his side. If the PCs have any information regarding incriminating objects within Wachterhaus, the Baron writes a warrant of investigation and assigns Izek and a platoon of six guards to ransack Fiona’s manor. Once any evidence is found - including the corpse of Nikolai Wachter or the animated skeletons in the basement - the Baron orders the immediate arrest of Lady Wachter and her children. Fiona and her sons are swiftly imprisoned in the stocks following a mockery of a trial, and Stella is locked away in St. Andral’s Orphanage for the rest of her maddened life. Fiona is able to escape arrest through the use of her arcane powers, and flees alongside Majesto and her three cult fanatics to seek refuge at Castle Ravenloft. Nikolai II and Karl are later tied to stakes above the wicker sun at the Festival of the Blazing Sun and burned alive as an example.</p>

<p>If Ernst or another of Fiona’s spies are alerted to the Baron’s intentions, Lady Wachter quickly moves to cleanse her home of all incriminating evidence, relocating any questionable items or texts to the secret chamber in her basement. If she is prepared for her own imminent arrest, she takes shelter in the cellar of one of her followers’ homes, and from there directs a guerilla rebellion that begins with the arson of the Burgomaster’s Manor.</p>
