<h2><a name="outline"></a>Outline</h2>

<p>Tser Pool encounter followed by the Tarokka Card reading with Madam Eva</p>

<p>The players arrive from the East Gate and Ireena will suggest to search for a <a href="n2">tavern</a> to gather information and rest.</p>

<p>Then they go to the Blue Water Inn and get some quests and learn a bit more about the city</p>

<p>In the evening they're invited to dinner by the Baron and learn about Lady Fiona</p>

<p>On the next day they have some spare time, so they explore the city or they just go straight to Wachterhaus</p>

<p>If they don't go to Wachterhaus then they receive an invitation from Lady Fiona herself and they get the quest to help her</p>

<p>On the third day they're free to explore and do whatever they want. They might learn about the bones if they haven't yet, they might check the Vistani camp and try to save Annabelle or they might go to the Winery</p>

<p>At night, if not prevented, the feast happens</p>

<h2><a name="tser-pool"></a>Tser Pool</h2>

<p><em>Music - Traveling Background</em></p>

<p><a href="/locations/tser-pool-encampment">Location Overview</a></p>

<p>The sun is setting as the party is leaving the Village of Barovia, Ismark suggest there is a Vistani camp near Tser Pool that they could make camp at.</p>

<p>Passive (Perception) DC 15 can hear happy, festive music echoing from the tress toward Tser Pool.</p>

<p><em>Music - Vistani Camp - Distance</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.</p>
  
  <p>The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.</p>
  
  <p>The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around a bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest's edge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The eight draft horses drinking from the river are used to pull the Vistani wagons and aren't easily startled.</p>

<p>Twelve Vistani (male and female human vistani bandits) are standing and sitting around the fire, telling stories and guzzling wine. They are intoxicated and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Three sober Vistani (male and female human vistani bandit captains) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised.</p>

<p>As soon as a Vistana catches sight of the approaching characters, they call out to the party as though greeting a host of long-lost friends. The characters are ushered into the camp and seated by the campfire where the Vistani provide them food and wine. The characters find themselves thrust into a world of color, music, and laughter far removed from the bleakness and darkness of Barovia and Death House, respectively.</p>

<p>Two Vistani serve as the characters' "handlers" while the party is at Tser Pool. The first is Arahja, a larger-than-life boisterous man whose laughter booms across the clearing. The second, Rina, is a quiet woman who speaks little; what she does say, however, is either profound or full of mischief. While other Vistani may greet and interrogate the characters, Arahja and Rina will ask most of the questions, and provide most of the exposition.</p>

<p>The Vistani may ask the characters any of the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>• Where are you coming from?</li>
<li>• From where do you hail?</li>
<li>• Where are you headed?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Music - Vistani Camp - Background 1</em></p>

<p>The Vistani are happy to speak of their arrangement with Strahd. They have no opinion of Strahd's dominion over Barovia, and tend to keep out of his way.</p>

<p>At some point, Arahja should make a passive joke about the character's entrapment in Barovia.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look at this one, Rina! His skin is so tan! Almost like Vistani, himself, eh?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rina might reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes; show it off while you can, giorgio. The coming years without sunlight are sure to steal it from you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If asked, the Vistani somberly inform the characters that no one leaves Barovia, and welcome them to their new home. The Vistani don't know how one might pass through the mists, but invite the characters to ask Madam Eva for insight.</p>

<p>If the characters linger at the camp, continue with "A Vistana's Tale" below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the Vistani tells them, "It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. Madam Eva foretold your coming. She awaits you." The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with "Madam Eva's Tent."</p>

<h3><a name="vistana-tale"></a>A Vistana's Tale</h3>

<p>If the characters linger by the fire, one of the Vistani recounts the following tale:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you're standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse.</p>
  
  <p>"When the vampire appeared, the wizard's peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.</p>
  
  <p>"The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard's magic couldn't save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard's body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited him away."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Vistana storyteller doesn't remember the wizard's name, but recalls that it sounded important. If the characters haven't spoken with Madam Eva, the storyteller urges them to do so.</p>

<h3><a name="madam-eva"></a>Madam Eva's Tent</h3>

<p>Madam Eva might seem mad, but she is, in fact, cunning and sharp of mind. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can't be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of Barovia from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with Strahd's (see the Madam Eva bio &amp; info of her character sheet). She does the vampire's bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger Strahd or bring harm to the Vistani. She never gives aid and never asks for any.</p>

<p>If the characters decide to see Madam Eva, read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. "At last you have arrived!" Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the characters approach Madam Eva's tent, she calls for them to enter before they even announce themselves. She addresses each of the characters by name without needing an introduction, and uses their full birth name instead of nicknames.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome</p>
  
  <p>Eygon Erian (A-Ree-Ann), lost as a child and now you're lost again my poor boy.</p>
  
  <p>Adran Galanodel (Aye-dren Guh-lan-uh-dell), do you still have mastery over your affliction?</p>
  
  <p>Bimmy Tuebosh, don't worry your family ghost knows better than to follow you here</p>
  
  <p>Mindelyn Akros (Ack-rose), blue flame took your family, don't let it take you too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the characters ask how she knows them, Madam Eva tells them that her cards grant her sight into the Threads of Fate that bind all things. Her Inner Eye, she tells them, told her that champions were coming to the land and that she would guide them on their path.</p>

<p>When the party has been ushered inside and is sitting around her table, she proclaims:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It took you all long enough! I have been expecting you. Are you ready to learn your fate?</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>After the Tarokka reading, Madam Eva shoos the party from her tent and tells them to go and have fun. The night proceeds festively, with more wine and laughter. The Vistani happily provide their guests with some bedrolls and a spare tent.</p>

<h2><a name="vallaki"></a>Vallaki</h2>

<p>The guards open the gate and before letting the party in they say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Once inside, the mention of the name "Strahd" is strictly illegal, even in written form. Know that even now as I say the name, it is the last time you will hear it within the gates. Instead, if you must refer to the aforementioned individual, you will refer to him simply as, "The Devil.""</p>
  
  <p>"This noble town holds a festival each week in honor of the resident's general merriment and continued support of the Burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich. As guests of Vallaki, you will not be required to aid in the preparation for our festivals. However, your attendance and participation in each and every festival is absolutely mandatory for the length of your stay. Failure to attend will be in strict opposition to Vallakian law. The next great Vallakian festival, the Festival of the Blazing Sun, will be held in three days time in the town square."</p>
  
  <p>"Failure to comply with any Vallakian law will mark you as criminals to our city and you will be punished as such in accordance to our justice system. If you have any questions, now is the time to ask them."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After your players are done going over Vallakian law, they'll reach the third and final step to get inside the town. The guards will ask that they present their weapons for registry.</p>

<p>Each player will essentially have a quick sheet written about them, detailing their name and appearance. On that same sheet, a scribe will list out that character's gear as well as any significant descriptions of said gear. If a player is carrying around the longsword from Death House, for instance, the scribe will record the windmill motif on the handle.</p>

<p>Most likely, at least one player will do their best to hide a weapon and/or use a fake name. It's only dnd survival instinct after all. If a player uses a false name, have them roll deception DC 12. The guards don't have too much of a way to check fake names, so it isn't a huge problem to have a false one written down. If a character tries to hide a weapon, have them roll slight of hand against a guard's passive perception.</p>

<p>If a guard catches a player trying to lie or hide something, they won't get too overtly angry. Barovia is a harsh place and travelers have to be wary, after all. A guard might instead just get annoyed by the lie, and will simply and firmly ask for the truth instead.</p>

<h4>Atmosphere</h4>

<p>Once getting inside the walls, the atmosphere of Vallaki should hit your players hard. But in a good way. The streets are teeming with people and there's the obvious sign of life everywhere. The volume of people in this area (while still light in comparison to most towns in other realms like Faerun) should shock them after what they've seen in the Village of Barovia. Even the Vistani camp at Tser Pool, while lively and friendly, was surrounded by the menacing woods. Vallaki should feel like a different, almost normal world to the characters.</p>

<p>While the characters' experience at the town gates should have given them a sign of Vallaki's oppression, the players' initial stroll through the streets shouldn't betray very much. The people here, though oppressed, are doing their best to live their lives as normally as possible. Remember, Vargas highly encourages smiles and happy moral, so passive jovial smiles aren't uncommon amongst Vallakians, however fake they may be.</p>

<h4>Random Encounter (1d6)</h4>

<ol>
<li>While walking through the streets, the characters pass a puppet show run by a brightly-dressed man - Rictavio. His small stage is surrounded by a half-dozen drab Barovians watching from the muddy cobblestones.</li>
<li>While walking through the streets, the characters pass a Dominionist follower of Lady Wachter preaching of “the coming of the Sun” to a paltry audience of three Barovians. One Loyalist jeers at the preacher, and a passing guard quells any dispute.</li>
<li>The characters are watched by a raven with blue-tipped wings. This raven is secretly Muriel Vinshaw of the Keepers of the Feather in raven form.</li>
<li>The characters notice two children pointing at Ireena and whispering. If approached, the children mention that Ireena looks exactly like Blinsky’s dolls.</li>
<li>An wild-eyed old man grabs the characters and yells about dark magic and purple flashes of light from the attic of the Burgomaster’s Manor in the night. Two guards rapidly approach and drag him away.</li>
<li>Two orphans stand on a street corner, singing a hymn to the Morninglord in off-key voices. The poorly-spelled sign on their bucket invites donations to St. Andral’s Orphanage. On closer inspection, one of the children has a dark bruise on their arm.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Roleplaying Ireena</h5>

<ul>
<li>• She suggests to search for a tavern to gather information and rest</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="n1"></a>N1 - St. Andral's Church</h3>

<h5>NPC</h5>

<ul>
<li>• Father Lucian Petrovich <em>(LG male human priest)</em></li>
<li>• Yeska <em>(LG male human noncombatant)</em></li>
<li>• Milivoj <em>(N male human commoner)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>At the church, the characters can learn from Father Lucian that the bones of St. Andral have been stolen, rendering its hallowed ground impotent. Father Lucian can also inform the characters that the local gravedigger, Milivoj, is the most likely person to have witnessed the theft. Finally, if the Feast of Saint Andral event is allowed to proceed, the church is specifically targeted by Ludmilla Vilisevic, Strahd's most senior bride and the organizer of the attack, along with one of her subordinate vampire spawn during the rampage.</p>

<p>When the characters first arrive at the Church of St. Andral, no matter the hour, they can find Willemina Rikalova in the pews, praying. If it is day, Father Lucian is beside her, comforting her. She has not left the chapel since her son, Udo Lukovich, was taken by Baron Vallakovich's men.</p>

<p>On any given evening, Father Lucian can be found delivering a sermon to 3d6+2 Vallakian worshippers. Otherwise, he can be found tending to the grounds, cleaning the pews or altar, reading to Yeska from a book of holy stories, eating a meal, or praying before the altar. Only on rare occasions does Father Lucian venture forth from the Church.</p>

<h3><a name="n2"></a>N2 - Blue Water Inn</h3>

<h5>NPC</h5>

<ul>
<li>• Urwin Martikov <em>(LG male human)</em></li>
<li>• Danika Dorakova <em>(LG female human)</em></li>
<li>• Brom and Bray Martikov</li>
<li>• Wolf Hunters - Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin <em>(N male human scouts)</em></li>
<li>• Wachter Brothers - Nikolai and Karl Wachter <em>(N male human nobles)</em></li>
<li>• Rictavio <em>(LG half-elf bard)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Should the characters request assistance finding lodging for the night, any guard or Vallakian resident will point them toward the Blue Water Inn for room and board.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gray smoke issues from the chimney of this large, two-story wooden building with a stone foundation and sagging tile roof, upon which several ravens have perched. A painted wooden sign hanging above the main entrance depicts a blue waterfall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A bed for the night costs 1 ep. Characters looking for something to eat are fed hot beet soup and fresh bread at no additional charge. A cooked wolf steak costs 1 ep.</p>

<p>The inn offers a pint of Purple Grapemash No. 3 wine for 3 cp, or a pint of the superior Red Dragon Crush wine for 1 sp. Urwin is hurt if the characters complain about the wines, for his family makes them.</p>

<p>Should the characters request a room at the Inn, Danika will have her boys, Brom and Bray, lead the way to their lodging. Brom and Bray are liable to prank one of the characters with one of their Blinsky toys, but will happily shower the characters with innocent questions regarding their race, equipment, and experiences in and outside of Barovia.</p>

<p>At the Inn, the characters can obtain information regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li>• the disappearance of Bluto Krogarov</li>
<li>• the delayed shipment of wine from the Wizard of Wines winery</li>
<li>• They can make friends with Nikolai and Karl Wachter</li>
<li>• obtain the services of Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin</li>
<li>• and interrogate the half-elf Rictavio regarding a Tarokka reading that describes him or the saber-toothed tiger within the carnival wagon in Arasek Stockyard.</li>
<li>• If the characters are collaborators with the Keepers of the Feather, they can also send and receive messages through Danika and Urwin Martikov to other members of the order.</li>
</ul>

<p>The inn's wine supply is almost depleted, and the latest delivery from the Wizard of Wines Winery is overdue. If the characters claim to be adventurers, Urwin asks them if they would be so kind as to find out what's holding up the latest shipment, promising them free room and board if they return with the wine.</p>

<p>Urwin takes you aside and keeps his voice low.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My supply of wine is nearly gone, and the next shipment is overdue. I'll give you what you seek if you bring me my wine. The vineyard and winery is a few miles west of here. Just follow the Old Svalich Road and the signs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Danika Martikov is a talkative barkeep, and can provide the characters with any or all of the following rumors, often without any prompting:</p>

<ul>
<li>• One of the Inn's best patrons and the town drunk, Bluto, hasn't been seen for a couple days. He's often found uselessly fishing on Lake Zarovich, north of town. At his last appearance in the tavern, he boasted of a special "good-luck" charm he had found that would ensure the success of his next fishing expedition. Bluto's wife, Vanessa, recently passed away due to illness.</li>
<li>• There have been no recent sightings of the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok. Folks used to see him skulking along the north shore of Lake Zarovich, shooting lightning bolts into the water to kill fish. His first sightings began around eleven months ago.</li>
<li>• The Baron's henchman, a brute with a demonic arm named Izek Strazni, recently arrested the local shoemaker, a man named Udo Lukovich, for "malicious unhappiness." Using some kind of dark magic, Izek burned his house to the ground as punishment for resisting arrest. Udo's family fled the burning house, and are currently staying with his mother, Willemina Rikalova, who spends much of her time at the church.</li>
<li>• The Vistani at the nearby western encampment have been restless over the past day or so. Rumors abound that they're searching for something, but no Vallakian has been brave enough to ask what.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should the characters run afoul of Vallakian law, the Martikovs will do their best to provide the party with sanctuary. The wereravens will put the party in the secret attic (area N2Q) to hide them from the Baron's men, allowing them entry and egress through the secret passage in area N2I. If any of the party's belongings are stolen or confiscated by the Vallakian guard, the Martikovs will steal and return them soon thereafter. Once the characters' trail has cooled, the Martikovs help them escape over the walls in the night and provide them with directions to the Wizard of Wines (if it still stands) or Krezk.</p>

<p>The wolf hunters Szoldar and Yevgeni can provide the characters a crude map of the area immediately surrounding Vallaki, bounded by Krezk to the west, the Winery/Argynvostholt to the south, Lake Zarovich to the north, and Old Bonegrinder to the east, providing it to the party for the cost of a night's worth of drinks.
The hunters can provide the characters direction to Milivoj if they wish to take up the quest, but do not know the location of the den, and view the mission as hopeless.</p>

<h3><a name="n3"></a>N3 - Burgomaster's Mansion</h3>

<h5>NPC</h5>

<ul>
<li>• Baron Vargas Vallakovich <em>(NE male human noble)</em></li>
<li>• Lydia Petrovna <em>(LG female human commoner)</em></li>
<li>• Victor Vallakovich <em>(NE male human mage)</em></li>
<li><p>• Izek Strazni</p>

<p>Finally, Danika Martikov is happy to inform the characters that the church is commonly rumored to be consecrated ground, protected from the influence of vampires or dark magic.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>🌙 Sᴛʀᴀɴᴅꜱ ᴏꜰ Fᴀᴛᴇ - Hᴏᴏᴋꜱ ᴏꜰ ᴛʜᴇ Bᴜʀɢᴏᴍᴀꜱᴛᴇʀ'ꜱ Mᴀɴꜱɪᴏɴ
If the characters are searching for a safe place for Ireena to stay, they may visit the Burgomaster's Mansion in order to obtain an audience with the Baron; after all, as effective Barovian nobility, it's not unlikely that the Baron would be willing to host her indefinitely. The Baron happily grants Ireena an audience and a spare bed in N3F, the Servants' Quarters.</p>

<p>The characters may enter the mansion on a wild goose chase in search of St. Andral's bones, or to investigate the strange purple lights that have been seen in the attic. If Izek has kidnapped Ireena, the characters will be able to find her kept captive in his room on the second floor. In either case, the Baron will bar them entry, forcing the characters to sneak in.</p>

<p>If the players meet Lady Fiona Wachter and earn her trust, she might ask them to investigate the mansion for signs of the Burgomaster's corruption. Fiona also desperately wants to know what Victor did to her daughter to cause the girl's madness. Baron Vallakovich, of course, will not willingly allow the characters to investigate his own domicile, requiring the party to break in and snoop around unless they bring an excellent cover story and succeed on a DC 20 Deception check.</p>

<p>If one or more of the characters have been imprisoned in the stocks, the party may seek mercy or information from the Baron in order to set their friends free. If the characters succeed on a DC 20 Persuasion or Intimidation check, the Baron agrees to release the character in exchange for a fine commensurate with the crime committed, with a minimum fee of 50 gp.</p>

<p>Finally, the characters may also visit the Burgomaster's Manor in order to obtain information from his library. Alternatively, if the party's Tarokka reading directed them to the Burgomaster's Mansion, they can find a treasure in the N3S, the Attic Storage, forgotten amongst piles of junk. If the characters are upfront regarding these requests, the Baron allows them inside only with a successful DC 15 Persuasion or Deception check - but only after summoning Izek Strazni, who accompanies the characters inside to ensure that they don't steal anything.
Iɴꜰɪʟᴛʀᴀᴛɪɴɢ ᴛʜᴇ Bᴀʀᴏɴ'ꜱ Mᴀɴᴏʀ
If the characters attempt to enter during the day, the front door and rear door are unlocked. However, the family's cook can always be found working in Area N3G (Kitchen), and there is a 40% chance that the family's maid is cleaning in one of the rooms adjoining Area N3a (Entrance Hall and Vestibule). Additionally, if characters sneak in before the Festival of the Blazing Sun, Lydia Petrovna and eight peasant commoners can be found preparing decorations in Area N3c (Dining Room). The characters must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check to sneak past any occupied room; a character that fails this skill check must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check to duck into one of the adjoining rooms and hide.</p>

<p>If the party infiltrates the Baron's mansion during the night, the characters must evade the attention of the Baron's two slumbering mastiffs, who sleep in N3i., the Upstairs Gallery. While asleep, their collars are chained to a ring set into the wall. The dogs awake if the characters pass by and no attempts are made at stealth.</p>

<p>Nature (DC 20 - Hard) can provide information regarding the best way to avoid awakening a slumbering canine.
Animal Handling (DC 15 - Moderate) can allow a character to calm the dogs if awoken. This check is made with advantage if the characters provide some kind of food.
Stealth (DC 15 - Moderate) can allow the characters to sneak past, letting the sleeping dogs lie.
Levelled Spells (Automatic Success) such as Animal Friendship; or features like a Firbolg's Speech of Beast and Leaf (Persuasion DC 10 - Easy) can allow a character to keep the dogs quiet.</p>

<p>If the characters fail their check, the dogs awaken, requiring an Animal Handling check (DC 15 - Moderate) to quell their barks, or a Stealth check (DC 15 - Moderate) to hide elsewhere in the mansion before the Baron arrives.</p>

<p>If the characters enter the mansion during the day, the Baron and his dogs can be found in Area N3L (library), with the door closed. Additionally, if the family's maid is not cleaning downstairs, there is a 60% chance that she is cleaning one of the rooms on the second floor. (Otherwise, she is out running errands about town.)</p>

<p>Should the characters be discovered inside of the manor by Lydia, the maid, the cook, or Lydia's female peasant helpers, they can successfully persuade their discoverer that the Baron has requested their presence with a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check (made with advantage if the characters are disguised as ordinary Vallakians, or if the characters have been discovered by one of Lydia's helpers). If a character fails this Deception check, their discoverer prepares to call for Baron Vallakovich in his study on the second floor, and can only be dissuaded from doing so if the party promises to leave immediately and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>

<p>Should the characters be discovered inside of the manor by Baron Vallakovich, only a DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check can convince him that the characters have a legitimate reason for being there (made with disadvantage if the characters have broken in at night, and with advantage if the characters were allowed in by Lydia or one of the servants and mention that fact). If the characters succeed on this check and were not discovered in a compromising position, the Baron leads them to Area N3l (library) and commands them to explain themselves. If this check is failed, or if the characters were discovered in an obviously criminal position (e.g., searching the Baron's bedroom or freeing Udo Lukovich from his restraints), he swiftly calls for Izek to arrest the characters on the spot (if it is night) or sends Lydia to alert the guards on duty that his home has been invaded by servants of Strahd (if it is day).</p>

<p>Under no circumstances does Izek use his Hurl Flame ability if fighting within the mansion's walls.
N3T. Vɪᴄᴛᴏʀ'ꜱ Wᴏʀᴋʀᴏᴏᴍ
The Glyph of Warding set into the door of this room casts the Suggestion spell, rather than triggering lightning damage, when opened. Any creature that opens the door must succeed on a DC14 Wisdom saving throw or else be Suggested to proceed downstairs and ignore whatever reason they may have had for entering.</p>

<p>If the characters enter this room at night, Victor has fallen asleep at this desk.</p>

<h3><a name="n4"></a>N4 - Wachterhaus</h3>

<p>🌙 Sᴛʀᴀɴᴅꜱ ᴏꜰ Fᴀᴛᴇ - Hᴏᴏᴋꜱ ᴏꜰ Wᴀᴄʜᴛᴇʀʜᴀᴜꜱ
The characters may snoop around Wachterhaus under the direction of Baron Vallakovich, who wants the characters to obtain evidence of Wachter's treachery. They might also join Lady Wachter for dinner on the invitation of Ernst Larnak, or request access to the Wachters' library to search for information. If the party's Tarokka reading directed them to Wachterhaus, they can find a treasure in the closet of N4O, the Master Bedroom, in the iron chest containing Leo Dilisnya's bones.
N4S. Cᴇʟʟᴀʀ
If a snooping character encounters the skeletons in Lady Wachter's basement and confronts her about it, she claims that she had them raised to serve as builders for her unfinished wine cellar, but found them to be far too unintelligent to properly construct anything, and is in the process of having them repurposed as guards. She justifies her use of necromantic magic by claiming that "so long as any action is taken beneath the Morninglord's sight, it is good and proper and just."</p>

<h3><a name="n5"></a>N5 - Arasek Stockyard</h3>

<h5>NPC</h5>

<ul>
<li>• Gunther and Yelena Arasek (LG male and female commoners)</li>
</ul>

<p>🌙 Sᴛʀᴀɴᴅꜱ ᴏꜰ Fᴀᴛᴇ - Hᴏᴏᴋꜱ ᴛᴏ Aʀᴀꜱᴇᴋ Sᴛᴏᴄᴋʏᴀʀᴅ
If the characters are searching for a general store where they can purchase basic adventuring gear, nearly any Vallakian citizen can point them toward Arasek Goods, located at the southwestern end of Arasek Stockyard. The characters might also choose to investigate the Stockyard after awakening Milivoj at St. Andral's Orphanage to search for clues left from the meetings between him and his mysterious employer.</p>

<p>It is also possible that the characters (correctly) deduce from clues elsewhere that Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker, is the man who persuaded Milivoj to steal the Bones of St. Andral. If so, they can locate his shop on the southeastern side of the Stockyard.</p>

<p>Finally, if the characters become suspicious of Rictavio, or believe that his wagon may contain one of the treasures referenced in their Tarokka reading, they can easily discover that his wagon is hitched at the center of the Stockyard. If the characters first confront Rictavio in person and mention their Tarokka reading, he asks them to meet him in his room at the Blue Water Inn within the hour and slips away to retrieve the lead-lined box containing the treasure from his wagon.</p>

<p>When the characters enter Arasek Stockyard, they can see two signs at the southern end: "Arasek Goods," and a coffin-shaped sign bearing no words that marks the entrance of the coffin-maker's shop (N6).</p>

<p>🦋 Tʜᴇ Bᴜᴛᴛᴇʀꜰʟʏ Eꜰꜰᴇᴄᴛ - Sᴇᴛᴛɪɴɢ Rᴀᴍᴇꜱᴇꜱ Fʀᴇᴇ
If the characters open the back door of Rictavio's carnival wagon without Rictavio present, they must succeed on a DC12 Dexterity saving throw and a contested Strength (Athletics) roll to slam the door shut on the saber-toothed tiger before it can escape. Otherwise, the tiger (whom Van Richten has named Rameses) breaks from his rickety prison and bounds away into the alleys of Vallaki in an effort to locate Rictavio or Piccolo. For more information on running this encounter, see the Tyger, Tyger special event.</p>

<h3><a name="n6"></a>N6 - Coffin Maker's Shop</h3>

<p>🌙 Sᴛʀᴀɴᴅꜱ ᴏꜰ Fᴀᴛᴇ - Hᴏᴏᴋꜱ ᴛᴏ ᴛʜᴇ Cᴏꜰꜰɪɴ Mᴀᴋᴇʀ'ꜱ Sʜᴏᴘ
If the characters interpret Milivoj's clues correctly, they may deduce that Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker, is the man who persuaded Milivoj to steal the Bones of St. Andral. Once the party learns that Milivoj met with his mysterious employer at Arasek Stockyard, they might attempt to ask Henrik if he saw those meetings from his shop window (and, of course, be turned away).</p>

<p>Instead of barred from the inside, the side door to the Coffin Maker's shop is locked, and may be unlocked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check. Henrik keeps the only key upon his person.
N6E. Hᴇɴʀɪᴋ'ꜱ Bᴇᴅʀᴏᴏᴍ
Soon after Henrik takes the Bones of St. Andral from Milivoj, he stores them here, in the secret compartment of the wardrobe in this room. The night after he informs Ludmilla of his success, she enters the bedroom in secret and places two Glyphs of Warding beneath the sack containing the bones. These glyphs are triggered when the sack containing the bones is removed. Both glyphs are nearly invisible; only a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check can allow a character to detect the thin lines of arcane energy poking past the edge of the sack.</p>

<p>The first Glyph is a Spell Glyph; once triggered, it casts a Clairvoyance spell that provides Ludmilla with a direct line of sight to this chamber and any characters within it (assuming that Ludmilla is present in the Vistani Encampment, Vallaki itself, or any of the surrounding area).</p>

<p>The second Glyph is a set of Explosive Runes that erupt with magical energy in a sphere of 20-foot-radius when triggered. Each creature in the affected area (even if around a corner) must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 cold damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. Ludmilla chose the cold damage type to prevent anyone outside the shop from hearing the explosion of the runes.</p>

<p>🦋 Tʜᴇ Bᴜᴛᴛᴇʀꜰʟʏ Eꜰꜰᴇᴄᴛ - Tʀɪɢɢᴇʀɪɴɢ ᴛʜᴇ Rᴜɴᴇꜱ
If the glyphs are triggered, the six vampire spawn in the Vampire Nest (N6F) instantly awaken and attack any characters on the second floor before searching for survivors lurking on the main floor.</p>

<p>If the characters or the Baron's guards forced Henrik to retrieve the bones himself, he is killed in the ensuing explosion, leaving the location of the five hidden vampire spawn a mystery. Only through asking the right questions and a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check can the characters learn that Henrik was recently commissioned to make heavy repairs to the gallows' platform in the Town Square.</p>

<p>If Ludmilla sees only Henrik when her Clairvoyance spell is triggered, she casts Clairvoyance a second time to confirm that the bottom of the shop is empty as well. If she detects the presence of the characters in the shop, she quickly presumes the worst and casts Sending to direct the six vampire spawn to eliminate all intruders in all rooms of the coffin shop. She then makes her way to the Church of Saint Andral to await any characters that may return with the bones.</p>

<h3><a name="n7"></a>N7 - Blinsky Toys</h3>

<p>🌙 Sᴛʀᴀɴᴅꜱ ᴏꜰ Fᴀᴛᴇ - Hᴏᴏᴋꜱ ᴛᴏ Bʟɪɴꜱᴋʏ Tᴏʏꜱ
Picking Up a Present: The characters may make their way to Blinsky Toys to purchase a toy for Arabelle after accepting Eliza's Picking Up a Present sidequest in Tser Pool Encampment. If they do, Blinsky recognizes Arabelle's physical description and is happy to do business with them.</p>

<p>The Man with the Monkey: The characters may make their way to Blinsky Toys after learning from Danika Martikov of an "entertaining man with a monkey" that fits the relevant Tarokka reading for Strahd's Enemy. Blinsky protests any idea that he might be suitable for opposing the Devil of Castle Ravenloft, but can inform the characters that he purchased the monkey from a man named Rictavio, who is currently staying at the Blue Water Inn.</p>

<p>The Missing Vistana: If the characters accept the Missing Vistana quest from Luvash and Arrigal at the Vistani Camp outside Vallaki (area N9), the residents of St. Andral's Orphanage can inform them that a grubby-looking man offered to purchase Arabelle some toys at Blinsky Toys. Blinsky can inform them that the man was Bluto Korgarov, one of the local fishermen. Bluto came by the previous day accompanying a girl fitting Arabelle's description and bought her a pair of zombie dolls before leaving. Bluto told Blinsky that he was "taking Arabelle fishing." Blinsky found the entire affair strange, as he did not know Bluto to have any children of his own.</p>

<p>Tyger, Tyger: If the characters chase after the escaped Rameses, the saber-toothed tiger, either during the Tyger, Tyger special event or accidentally freeing him themselves, they can find him here, having broken through the window of the shop in an attempt to reunite with Piccolo, the monkey. The characters find Piccolo happily perched on Rameses' shoulder while Blinsky hides and whimpers from a top shelf of his shop.</p>

<h3><a name="n8"></a>N8 - Town Square</h3>

<p>🌙 Sᴛʀᴀɴᴅꜱ ᴏꜰ Fᴀᴛᴇ - Hᴏᴏᴋꜱ ᴏꜰ ᴛʜᴇ Tᴏᴡɴ Sǫᴜᴀʀᴇ
Due to its nature as a nexus of transportation rather than a destination, it is rare that your characters will head toward the Town Square specifically. Instead, they are likely to pass through it while traveling between Arasek Stockyard and the Burgomaster's Mansion. Any character that takes the time to explore Vallaki will also naturally find themselves passing through the Town Square, a central point of commerce and travel in Vallaki.</p>

<p>Additionally, several shops are located in the Town Square. Any character searching for some kind of commerce will be able to find their way to the appropriate shop within 30 minutes after succeeding on a DC 5 Intelligence (Investigation check), or within 15 minutes by passing a DC 10 check. Before ascending Mount Ghakis toward the Amber Temple, it may behoove the characters to commission sets of warm winter clothing from Endless Delight Clothiers, located on the southeastern side of the square.</p>

<p>If the characters decide to attend the Festival of the Blazing Sun, they will be able to enjoy the climax of the Festival at the center of the Square.</p>

<p>The Town Square is the heart of Vallaki. Between the posters advertising the Festival of the Blazing Sun, the watchful eye of Izek Strazni, and the spectacle of the stocks, any party visiting the Square will quickly gain an appreciation for the culture and current state of Vallaki.</p>

<p>Because Izek can often be found lurking within or nearby the area, no Vallakian will freely speak with the characters while in or around the Town Square. These citizens may glare and snarl at the characters when approached; happily bubble with Baron-approved propaganda; or entirely ignore the party if approached.</p>

<p>Though a stone fountain lies at the geographic center of the Town Square, the stocks are the clear centerpiece. Unlike in the module, Izek cannot be found here when your characters first arrive. Instead, the townsfolk speak of his name in terrified whispers if the characters suggest any hint of disloyalty or conspiracy.</p>

<p>🎨 Wᴏʀᴛʜ ᴀ Tʜᴏᴜꜱᴀɴᴅ Wᴏʀᴅꜱ - Pᴏꜱᴛᴇʀꜱ ꜰᴏʀ ᴛʜᴇ Fᴇꜱᴛɪᴠᴀʟ ᴏꜰ ᴛʜᴇ Bʟᴀᴢɪɴɢ Sᴜɴ
While exploring the Town Square, the characters can find many copies of this poster advertising the Festival of the Blazing Sun.</p>

<p>Should a tense situation descend into combat, feel free to use this Town Square battlemap.
Dᴏɴᴋᴇʏ-Hᴇᴀᴅᴇᴅ Cʀɪᴍɪɴᴀʟꜱ
If the characters approach the men and women in the stocks, a terrified Vallakian peasant approaches to warn the party that providing comfort or aid to criminals in punishable by ten days in the stocks, while attempting to free those in the stocks is also punishable by a public flogging. If any characters try to free the prisoners anyway, or are caught doing so, the peasant swiftly vanishes into the crowd, but swiftly reports their crime to Izek when he next returns to make his rounds.
Sʜᴏᴘꜱ ᴏꜰ Vᴀʟʟᴀᴋɪ
There are several shops in Vallaki's Town Square where your characters can purchase basic goods and supplies.
Tʜᴇ Cʀᴀᴄᴋᴇᴅ Aɴᴠɪʟ
Owned by blacksmith Dragomir Ulbrek, The Cracked Anvil is the proud purveyor of functional pieces including horseshoes, nails, hinges, spearheads, arrowheads, and daggers. Dragomir can also sell shortswords and longswords at twice the listed price in the Player's Handbook, and can repair any nonmagical weapon or piece of armor for half of its normal price. He can also silver weapons for the characters, but at the exorbitant price of 200 gp per weapon, and only has enough materials to silver two weapons without the characters purchasing more from the Vistani.</p>

<p>As raw materials for new equipment are so hard to come by in Barovia, he will also pay the listed price in the Player's Handbook for any weapons offered for sale. Because of this, he often has a small and eclectic collection of weapons and armors for sale obtained from the remains of dead adventurers.</p>

<p>Magda Ulbrek, Vallaki's only fletcher and Dragomir's wife, also works out of this shop. She can make bows and arrows for sale at twice the normal price, and will take a period of two days to create a new bow from scratch.
Lᴜᴋʀᴇꜱʜ Tᴀɴɴᴇʀʏ
Lukresh Tannery is owned by the dark-humored and abrasive Fatima Lukresh. She is most experienced in the production of straps, harnesses, and belts, but can craft normal and studded leather armor on commission if asked. Her work is crude, but functional.
Eɴᴅʟᴇꜱꜱ Dᴇʟɪɢʜᴛ Cʟᴏᴛʜɪᴇʀꜱ
The three Alastroi siblings, Alek, Andrej, and Alana own and operate Endless Delight Clothiers (formerly named Alastroi Clothiers, until the Baron pressured them into renaming it). They are a weaver, cobbler, and tailor, respectively. The Baron frequently commissions their shop to produce the outfits and decorations for his festivals, leaving them highly skilled at their trade in a constant effort to please him. They are experienced crafters of warm clothing.
Vᴀʟʟᴀᴋɪ Wᴀɢᴏɴ Rᴇᴘᴀɪʀ
Vallaki's most experienced wainwright is a gruff, unpleasant man named Tural. He occasionally exits Vallaki to do business with the Vistani, which leaves him a social pariah amongst some of the more mistrustful townsfolk. However, if the characters need an introduction to the Vistani near town, Tural is happy to provide it.
Tʜᴇ Aᴘᴏᴛʜᴇᴄᴀʀʏ
The Apothecary is owned by a soft-spoken, but nonetheless eccentric man named Harkus Stefanovich. Possessed with an unnerving bedside manner and a lack of appreciation for personal space, Harkus is nonetheless a simple apothecary, rather than a potion-maker or alchemist. He is perfectly qualified to produce simple remedies, poultices, and tinctures, but quite ignorant of the materials or skills needed to produce Potions of Healing or similar items. He can sell the characters a Healer's Kit at twice the normal price.</p>

The Missing Vistana: Upon rescuing Arabelle from Bluto at Lake Zarovich, the characters will be directed to return her to her father, Luvash, at this encampment. Should they recover her drowned body, she is recognizable as a Vistana from her clothes and complexion.</p>

<p>Tarokka Treasures: If Madam Eva's Tarokka reading informs the characters that a treasure can be found here, it is located within the Vistani Treasure Wagon (area N9I).</p>

<p>If the characters successfully rescue Arabelle, Luvash tells them that some members of their camp routinely make trips to the world outside Barovia. Should the characters pay half of the price upfront, the caravan would be happy to pick up some minor mundane or magical items on their behalf, deliverable in four days. The Vistani refuse to purchase holy water or any items hazardous to the undead, however, due to their stance of neutrality toward Strahd.</p>

<h3><a name="lore"></a> Vallaki Lore</h3>

<ul>
<li>• The <a href="#n2">Blue Water Inn</a> offers food, wine, and shelter to visitors. A stranger with pointed ears is staying there. He came to Barovia from a distant land, riding into town on a carnival wagon.</li>
<li>• The burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich, has decreed that the Festival of the Blazing Sun will be held in the <a href="n8">town square</a> in three days. The previous festival, which he called the Wolf's Head Jamboree, was less than a week ago.</li>
<li>• Vallaki has endured at least one festival every week for the past several years. Some Vallakians believe that the festivals keep the devil Strahd at bay. Others think they provide no protection or benefit whatsoever. Most consider them dismal affairs.</li>
<li>• Those who speak ill of the festivals are declared by the burgomaster to be in league with the devil Strahd and arrested. Some are thrown in the <a href="n8">stocks</a>, while others are taken to the burgomaster's mansion so that the baron can purge them of their evil.</li>
<li>• The burgomaster's henchman, Izek Strazni, has a history of violence as well as a fiendish deformity: a monstrous arm with which he can conjure fire. Fear of Izek keeps the baron's enemies at bay.</li>
<li>• No one hates the burgomaster more than Lady Fiona Wachter, who is often quoted as saying, "I'd rather serve the devil than a madman." She owns an <a href="n4">old house in town</a> but rarely leaves her estate. Her two adult sons, Nikolai and Karl, are local trouble makers. Lady Wachter also has a mad daughter whom she keeps locked away. The burgomaster doesn't confront Fiona or her offspring because he is afraid of Lady Wachter, whose family has old ties to Strahd.</li>
<li>• Purple flashes of light have been seen emanating from the attic of the burgomaster's mansion.</li>
<li>• Wolves and direwolves prowl the woods and aren't afraid to attack travelers on the Old Svalich Road. Well-armed groups of hunters and trappers have managed to kill several of the wolves, but more keep coming.</li>
<li>• It's too dangerous to go fishing on Lake Zarovich (chapter 2, area L), but the threat of Strahd's wolves hasn't stopped Bluto Krogarov, the town drunk, from trying. He sets out each morning and returns every evening, but hasn't caught any fish in a while.</li>
<li>• There have been no recent sightings of the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok (chapter 2, area M ). Folks used to see him skulking along the north shore of Lake Zarovich, shooting lightning bolts into the water to kill the fish. (If the characters seem interested in meeting this wizard, locals recommend that they use the fishing boats on the south shore to cross the lake, because it's shorter and a lot less dangerous than walking around the lake.</li>
<li>• There's a Vistani camp in the woods <a href="n9">southwest of town</a>. The Vistani there aren't very friendly. Vistani aren't welcome in Vallaki.</li>
<li>• West of town is a haunted mansion (see chapter 7, "Argynvostholt"). Legend has it that a dragon died there long, long ago.</li>
<li>• South of town is a village that has been abandoned for decades. Its burgomaster committed some terrible offense and incurred the wrath of Strahd.</li>
