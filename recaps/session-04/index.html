<p>Things to Remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>• Allow for a quick discussion before each round of combat. Disallow combat tatic discussion between player turns.</li>
<li>• If a player isn't ready for their action, they get skipped.</li>
<li>• Separate commonly used dice.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="outline"></a>Outline</h2>

<p>Tser Pool encounter followed by the Tarokka Card reading with Madam Eva</p>

<p>The players arrive from the East Gate and Ireena will suggest to search for a <a href="n2">tavern</a> to gather information and rest.</p>

<p>Then they go to the Blue Water Inn and get some quests and learn a bit more about the city</p>

<p>In the evening they're invited to dinner by the Baron and learn about Lady Fiona</p>

<p>On the next day they have some spare time, so they explore the city or they just go straight to Wachterhaus</p>

<p>If they don't go to Wachterhaus then they receive an invitation from Lady Fiona herself and they get the quest to help her</p>

<p>On the third day they're free to explore and do whatever they want. They might learn about the bones if they haven't yet, they might check the Vistani camp and try to save Annabelle or they might go to the Winery</p>

<p>At night, if not prevented, the feast happens</p>

<h2><a name="tser-pool"></a>Tser Pool</h2>

<p><em>Music - Traveling Background</em></p>

<p><a href="/locations/tser-pool-encampment">Location Overview</a></p>

<p>The sun is setting as the party is leaving the Village of Barovia, Ismark suggest there is a Vistani camp near Tser Pool that they could make camp at.</p>

<p>Passive (Perception) DC 15 can hear happy, festive music echoing from the tress toward Tser Pool.</p>

<p><em>Music - Vistani Camp - Distance</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.</p>
  
  <p>The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.</p>
  
  <p>The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around a bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest's edge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The eight draft horses drinking from the river are used to pull the Vistani wagons and aren't easily startled.</p>

<p>Twelve Vistani (male and female human vistani bandits) are standing and sitting around the fire, telling stories and guzzling wine. They are intoxicated and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Three sober Vistani (male and female human vistani bandit captains) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised.</p>

<p>As soon as a Vistana catches sight of the approaching characters, they call out to the party as though greeting a host of long-lost friends. The characters are ushered into the camp and seated by the campfire where the Vistani provide them food and wine. The characters find themselves thrust into a world of color, music, and laughter far removed from the bleakness and darkness of Barovia and Death House, respectively.</p>

<p>Two Vistani serve as the characters' "handlers" while the party is at Tser Pool. The first is Arahja, a larger-than-life boisterous man whose laughter booms across the clearing. The second, Rina, is a quiet woman who speaks little; what she does say, however, is either profound or full of mischief. While other Vistani may greet and interrogate the characters, Arahja and Rina will ask most of the questions, and provide most of the exposition.</p>

<p>The Vistani may ask the characters any of the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>• Where are you coming from?</li>
<li>• From where do you hail?</li>
<li>• Where are you headed?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Music - Vistani Camp - Background 1</em></p>

<p>The Vistani are happy to speak of their arrangement with Strahd. They have no opinion of Strahd's dominion over Barovia, and tend to keep out of his way.</p>

<p>At some point, Arahja should make a passive joke about the character's entrapment in Barovia.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look at this one, Rina! His skin is so tan! Almost like Vistani, himself, eh?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rina might reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes; show it off while you can, giorgio. The coming years without sunlight are sure to steal it from you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If asked, the Vistani somberly inform the characters that no one leaves Barovia, and welcome them to their new home. The Vistani don't know how one might pass through the mists, but invite the characters to ask Madam Eva for insight.</p>

<p>If the characters linger at the camp, continue with "A Vistana's Tale" below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the Vistani tells them, "It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. Madam Eva foretold your coming. She awaits you." The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with "Madam Eva's Tent."</p>

<h3><a name="vistana-tale"></a>A Vistana's Tale</h3>

<p>If the characters linger by the fire, one of the Vistani recounts the following tale:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you're standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse.</p>
  
  <p>"When the vampire appeared, the wizard's peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.</p>
  
  <p>"The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard's magic couldn't save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard's body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited him away."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Vistana storyteller doesn't remember the wizard's name, but recalls that it sounded important. If the characters haven't spoken with Madam Eva, the storyteller urges them to do so.</p>

<h3><a name="madam-eva"></a>Madam Eva's Tent</h3>

<p>Madam Eva might seem mad, but she is, in fact, cunning and sharp of mind. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can't be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of Barovia from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with Strahd's (see the Madam Eva bio &amp; info of her character sheet). She does the vampire's bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger Strahd or bring harm to the Vistani. She never gives aid and never asks for any.</p>

<p>If the characters decide to see Madam Eva, read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. "At last you have arrived!" Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the characters approach Madam Eva's tent, she calls for them to enter before they even announce themselves. She addresses each of the characters by name without needing an introduction, and uses their full birth name instead of nicknames.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome</p>
  
  <p>Eygon Erian (A-Ree-Ann), lost as a child and now you're lost again my poor boy.</p>
  
  <p>Adran Galanodel (Aye-dren Guh-lan-uh-dell), do you still have mastery over your affliction?</p>
  
  <p>Bimmy Tuebosh, don't worry your family ghost knows better than to follow you here</p>
  
  <p>Mindelyn Akros (Ack-rose), blue flame took your family, don't let it take you too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the characters ask how she knows them, Madam Eva tells them that her cards grant her sight into the Threads of Fate that bind all things. Her Inner Eye, she tells them, told her that champions were coming to the land and that she would guide them on their path.</p>

<p>When the party has been ushered inside and is sitting around her table, she proclaims:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It took you all long enough! I have been expecting you. Are you ready to learn your fate?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="tarroka"></a>Tarokka Card Reading</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>The 6 of Coins – Beggar</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy.
  A wounded elf has what you seek. He will part with the treasure to see his dark dreams fulfilled.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The 7 of Stars – Illusionist</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.
  A man is not what he seems. He comes here in a carnival wagon. Therein lies what you seek.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The 5 of Swords – Myrmidon</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight
  Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The Raven</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness.
  Find the leader of the feathered ones who live among the vines. Though old, he has one more fight left in him.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The Artifact</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond morality. This card will lead you to him!
  He lurks in the darkness where the morning light once shone – a sacred place</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>After the Tarokka reading, Madam Eva shoos the party from her tent and tells them to go and have fun. The night proceeds festively, with more wine and laughter. The Vistani happily provide their guests with some bedrolls and a spare tent.</p>

<h2><a name="vallaki"></a>Vallaki</h2>

<p>The guards open the gate and before letting the party in they say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Once inside, the mention of the name "Strahd" is strictly illegal, even in written form. Know that even now as I say the name, it is the last time you will hear it within the gates. Instead, if you must refer to the aforementioned individual, you will refer to him simply as, "The Devil.""</p>
  
  <p>"This noble town holds a festival each week in honor of the resident's general merriment and continued support of the Burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich. As guests of Vallaki, you will not be required to aid in the preparation for our festivals. However, your attendance and participation in each and every festival is absolutely mandatory for the length of your stay. Failure to attend will be in strict opposition to Vallakian law. The next great Vallakian festival, the Festival of the Blazing Sun, will be held in three days time in the town square."</p>
  
  <p>"Failure to comply with any Vallakian law will mark you as criminals to our city and you will be punished as such in accordance to our justice system. If you have any questions, now is the time to ask them."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After your players are done going over Vallakian law, they'll reach the third and final step to get inside the town. The guards will ask that they present their weapons for registry.</p>

<p>Each player will essentially have a quick sheet written about them, detailing their name and appearance. On that same sheet, a scribe will list out that character's gear as well as any significant descriptions of said gear. If a player is carrying around the longsword from Death House, for instance, the scribe will record the windmill motif on the handle.</p>

<p>Most likely, at least one player will do their best to hide a weapon and/or use a fake name. It's only dnd survival instinct after all. If a player uses a false name, have them roll deception DC 12. The guards don't have too much of a way to check fake names, so it isn't a huge problem to have a false one written down. If a character tries to hide a weapon, have them roll slight of hand against a guard's passive perception.</p>

<p>If a guard catches a player trying to lie or hide something, they won't get too overtly angry. Barovia is a harsh place and travelers have to be wary, after all. A guard might instead just get annoyed by the lie, and will simply and firmly ask for the truth instead.</p>

<h4>Atmosphere</h4>

<p>Once getting inside the walls, the atmosphere of Vallaki should hit your players hard. But in a good way. The streets are teeming with people and there's the obvious sign of life everywhere. The volume of people in this area (while still light in comparison to most towns in other realms like Faerun) should shock them after what they've seen in the Village of Barovia. Even the Vistani camp at Tser Pool, while lively and friendly, was surrounded by the menacing woods. Vallaki should feel like a different, almost normal world to the characters.</p>

<p>While the characters' experience at the town gates should have given them a sign of Vallaki's oppression, the players' initial stroll through the streets shouldn't betray very much. The people here, though oppressed, are doing their best to live their lives as normally as possible. Remember, Vargas highly encourages smiles and happy moral, so passive jovial smiles aren't uncommon amongst Vallakians, however fake they may be.</p>

<h4>Random Encounter (1d6)</h4>

<ol>
<li>While walking through the streets, the characters pass a puppet show run by a brightly-dressed man - Rictavio. His small stage is surrounded by a half-dozen drab Barovians watching from the muddy cobblestones.</li>
<li>While walking through the streets, the characters pass a Dominionist follower of Lady Wachter preaching of “the coming of the Sun” to a paltry audience of three Barovians. One Loyalist jeers at the preacher, and a passing guard quells any dispute.</li>
<li>The characters are watched by a raven with blue-tipped wings. This raven is secretly Muriel Vinshaw of the Keepers of the Feather in raven form.</li>
<li>The characters notice two children pointing at Ireena and whispering. If approached, the children mention that Ireena looks exactly like Blinsky’s dolls.</li>
<li>An wild-eyed old man grabs the characters and yells about dark magic and purple flashes of light from the attic of the Burgomaster’s Manor in the night. Two guards rapidly approach and drag him away.</li>
<li>Two orphans stand on a street corner, singing a hymn to the Morninglord in off-key voices. The poorly-spelled sign on their bucket invites donations to St. Andral’s Orphanage. On closer inspection, one of the children has a dark bruise on their arm.</li>
</ol>
